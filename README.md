# This is the Read Me Generator

## Description
![read-me generator](./assets/generate-readmefile.gif)
I was motivated to create this application so I could create readme files with ease, instead of having to do all the formatting. This  reduces the amount of time necessary to put into a project. I learned how to use FS better and also how to generate a markdown file with ease.
